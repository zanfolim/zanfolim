- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tedi Zanfolim (@zanfolim)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software design and development. I do believe well designed software can help drive great business results (of course, the business has to be good as well :-)))
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning more: how to get agile in a more prescriptive maner is what I am looking at more recently from a process perspective. More technically, AWS/GCP/Azure features as I can, besides some Google Dialog flow and trying to keep up with spring and java new features.
